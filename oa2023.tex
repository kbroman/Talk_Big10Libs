  \note{
      In thinking about Open Scholarship, I'm generally thinking of four
      things: open access publications, open educational resources,
      open source software, and open science (by which I mean open
      data, methods, and materials).

      I'm going to focus mostly on Open Access publications, and on
      academic scientists.

      Concerns in the humanities can be quite different, and I'm going
      to focus on what I know best, which is the situation in science.

  \note{
     I thought I should say a bit about my experience with the
     publication process.

     My research spans genetics and statistics, but the majority of my
     publications are in the genetics or biology literature; I only
     have a couple of papers in statistics journals.

     I've reviewed for a lot of different journals, and I spent a
     decade as an editor for the society journal, Genetics.

    The paper concerns how to organize data in spreadsheets. And
    really that spreadsheets shouldn't be organized like this example,
    but rather as a rectangle with the columns being the measured
    variables and one row per subject, and a single header row.

  \note{
    Nevertheless, I paid nearly \$3000 to have the published paper
    available open access.

    I struggled with the decision of whether to pay this fee. But I'm
    glad that I did.

    I think audience for this paper was made much more widespread by
    being a formal paper (rather than a preprint, and before that
    basically a blog post).
